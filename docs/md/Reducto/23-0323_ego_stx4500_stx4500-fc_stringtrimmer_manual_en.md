GENERAL BATTERY-OPERATED MACHINE SAFETY WARNINGS

A WARNING! Read all safety warnings, instructions, illustrations and specifications provided with this machine. Failure to follow all instructions listed below may result in electric shock, fire and/or serious injury.

SAVE ALL WARNINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.

The term "machine" in the warnings refers to your mains-operated (corded) machine or battery-operated (cordless) machine.

Work area safety

	■ Keep work area clean and well lit. Cluttered or dark areas invite accidents.

■ Do not operate machines in explosive atmospheres, such as in the presence of flammable liquids, gases or dust. Machines create sparks which may ignite the dust or fumes.

■ Keep children and bystanders away while operating a machine. Distractions can cause you to lose control.

Electrical safety

	■ Machine plugs must match the outlet. Never modify the plug in any way. Do not use any adapter plugs with earthed (grounded) machines. Unmodified plugs and matching outlets will reduce risk of electric shock.

■ Avoid body contact with earthed or grounded surfaces, such as pipes, radiators, ranges and refrigerators. There is an increased risk of electric shock if your body is earthed or grounded.

■ Do not operate the machine in rain or wet conditions. Water entering the machine may increase the risk of electric shock or malfunction that could result in personal injury.

■ Do not abuse the cord. Never use the cord for carrying, pulling or unplugging the machine. Keep cord away from heat, oil, sharp edges or moving parts. Damaged or entangled cords increase the risk of electric shock.

	■ When operating a machine outdoors, use an extension cord suitable for outdoor use. Use of a cord suitable for outdoor use reduces the risk of electric shock.

	■ If operating a machine in a damp location is unavoidable, use a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) protected supply. Use of a GFCI reduces the risk of electric shock.

Personal safety

	■ Stay alert, watch what you are doing and use common sense when operating a machine. Do not use a machine while you are tired or under the influence of drugs, alcohol or medication. A moment of inattention while operating machines may result in serious personal injury.

■ Use personal protective equipment. Always wear eye protection. Protective equipment such as a dust mask, non-skid safety shoes, hard hat or hearing protection used for appropriate conditions will reduce personal injuries.

■ Prevent unintentional starting. Ensure the switch is in the off-position before connecting to power source and/or battery pack, picking up or carrying the machine. Carrying machines with your finger on the switch or energizing machines that have the switch on invites accidents.

■ Remove any adjusting key or wrench before turning the machine on. A wrench or a key left attached to a rotating part of the machine may result in personal injury.

■ Do not overreach. Keep proper footing and balance at all times. This enables better control of the machine in unexpected situations.

■ Dress properly. Do not wear loose clothing or jewelry. Keep your hair and clothing away from moving parts. Loose clothes, jewelry or long hair can be caught in moving parts.

■ If devices are provided for the connection of dust extraction and collection facilities, ensure these are connected and properly used. Use of dust collection can reduce dust-related hazards.

■ Do not let familiarity gained from frequent use of machines allow you to become complacent and ignore machine safety principles. A careless action can cause severe injury within a fraction of a second.

Machine use and care

■Do not force the machine. Use the correct machine for your application. The correct machine will do the job better and safer at the rate for which it was designed.

■ Do not use the machine if the switch does not turn it on and off. Any machine that cannot be controlled with the switch is dangerous and must be repaired.

	■ Disconnect the plug from the power source and/or remove the battery pack, if detachable, from the machine before making any adjustments, changing

■ Do not expose a battery pack or machine to fire or excessive temperature. Exposure to fire or temperature above 265 °F (130 °C) may cause explosion.

■ Follow all charging instructions and do not charge the battery pack or machine outside the temperature range specified in the instructions. Charging improperly or at temperatures outside the specified range may damage the battery and increase the risk of fire.

Service

■ Have your machine serviced by a qualified repair person using only identical replacement parts. This will ensure that the safety of the machine is maintained.

■ Never service damaged battery packs. Service of battery packs should only be performed by the manufacturer or authorized service providers.

String trimmer and brush cutter safety warnings

	■ Do not use the machine in bad weather conditions, especially when there is a risk of lightning. This decreases the risk of being struck by lightning.

■ Thoroughly inspect the area for wildlife where the machine is to be used. Wildlife may be injured by the machine during operation.

■ Thoroughly inspect the area where the machine is to be used and remove all stones, sticks, wires, bones, and other foreign objects. Thrown objects can cause personal injury.

■ Before using the machine, always visually inspect to see that the cutter or blade and the cutter or blade assembly are not damaged. Damaged parts increase the risk of injury.

■ Follow instructions for changing accessories. Improperly tightened blade securing nuts or bolts may either damage the blade or result in it becoming detached.

■ The rated rotational speed of the blade must be at least equal to the maximum rotational speed marked on the machine. Blades running faster than their rated rotational speed can break and fly apart.

■ Wear eye, ear, head and hand protection. Adequate protective equipment will reduce personal injury by flying debris or accidental contact with the cutting line or blade.

■ While operating the machine, always wear safety footwear. Do not operate the machine when barefoot or wearing open sandals. This reduces the chance of injury to the feet from contact with a moving cutter, line or blade.

■ While operating the machine, always wear long trousers. Exposed skin increases the likelihood of injury from thrown objects.

■ Keep bystanders away while operating the machine. Thrown debris can result in serious personal injury.

■ Always use two hands when operating the machine. Holding the machine with both hands will avoid loss of control.

■ Hold the machine by the insulated gripping surfaces only, because the cutting line or blade may contact hidden wiring. Cutting line or blades contacting a "live" wire may make exposed metal parts of the machine "live" and could give the operator an electric shock.

■ Always keep proper footing and operate the machine only when standing on the ground. Slippery or unstable surfaces may cause a loss of balance or control of the machine.

■ Do not operate the machine on excessively steep slopes. This reduces the risk of loss of control, slipping and falling which may result in personal injury.

■ When working on slopes, always be sure of your footing, always work across the face of slopes, never up or down and exercise extreme caution when changing direction. This reduces the risk of loss of control, slipping and falling which may result in personal injury.

■ Keep all parts of the body away from the cutter, line or blade when the machine is operating. Before you start the machine, make sure the cutter, line or blade is not contacting anything. A moment of inattention while operating the machine may result in injury to yourself or others.

■ Do not operate the machine above waist height. This helps prevent unintended cutter or blade contact and enables better control of the machine in unexpected situations.

■ When cutting brush or saplings that are under tension, be alert for spring back. When the tension in the wood fibers is released, the brush or sapling may strike the operator and/or throw the machine out of control.

▪ Use extreme caution when cutting brush and saplings. The slender material may catch the blade and be whipped toward you or pull you off balance.

■ Maintain control of the machine and do not touch cutters, lines or blades and other hazardous moving parts while they are still in motion. This reduces the risk of injury from moving parts.

■ Carry the machine with the machine switched off and away from your body. Proper handling of the machine will reduce the likelihood of accidental contact with a moving cutter, line or blade.

■ Only use replacement cutters, lines, cutting heads and blades specified by the manufacturer. Incorrect replacement parts may increase the risk of breakage and injury.

■ When clearing jammed material or servicing the machine, make sure the switch is off and the battery pack is removed. Unexpected starting of the machine while clearing jammed material or servicing may result in serious personal injury.

■ When transporting or storing the machine, always fit the cover on metal blades.

■ Proper handling of the machine will reduce the likelihood of accidental contact with the blade.

■ Damage to Trimmer - If you strike a foreign object with the trimmer or it becomes entangled, stop the machine immediately, check for damage and have any damage repaired before further operation is attempted. Do not operate with a broken guard or spool.

■ If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the motor and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble. A loose head may vibrate, crack, break or come off the trimmer, which may result in serious or fatal injury. Make sure that the cutting attachment is properly fixed in position. If the head loosens after fixing it in position, replace it immediately. Never use a trimmer with a loose cutting attachment.

■ Use only with the battery packs and chargers listed below:

Blade thrust causes and related warnings

Blade thrust is a sudden sideways, forward or backward motion of the machine, which may occur when the blade jams or catches on an object such as a sapling or a tree stump. It can be violent enough to cause the machine and/or operator to be propelled in any direction, and possibly lose control of the machine.

Blade thrust and its related hazards can be avoided by taking proper precautions as given below.

	■ Maintain a firm grip with both hands on the machine and position your arms to resist blade thrust. Position your body to the left side of the machine. Blade thrust can increase the risk of injury due to the machine moving unexpectedly. Blade thrust can be controlled by the operator if proper precautions are taken.

■ If the blade binds, or when interrupting a cut for any reason, switch the machine off and hold the machine motionless in the material until the blade comes to a complete stop. While the blade is binding, never attempt to remove the machine from the material or pull the machine backward while the blade is in motion, otherwise blade thrust may occur. Investigate and take corrective actions to eliminate the cause of blade binding.

■ Do not use blunt or damaged blades. Blunt or damaged blades increase the risk of jamming or catching on an object, resulting in blade thrust.

■ Always maintain good visibility of the material being cut. Blade thrust is more likely to occur in areas where it is difficult to see the material being cut.

■ If you are approached by another person while operating the machine, switch the machine off. There is an increased risk of injury to other persons being struck by the moving blade in the event of blade thrust.

ADJUSTING THE CUTTING LINE
LENGTH

The trimmer head allows the operator to release more cutting line without stopping the motor. As line becomes frayed or worn, additional line can be released by lightly tapping the trimmer head on the ground while operating the trimmer (Fig. 10a).

![Figure](img_23-0323_ego_stx4500_stx4500-fc_stringtrimmer_manual_en_p32_60.png)

10a

A WARNING: Do not remove or alter the line-cutting blade assembly. Excessive line length will cause the motor to overheat and may result in serious personal injury.

For best results, tap the trimmer head on bare ground or hard soil. If line release is attempted in tall grass, the motor may overheat. Always keep the trimming line fully extended. Line release becomes more difficult as the cutting line becomes shorter. Replace the line when necessary. For instructions, please see section "LINE REPLACEMENT".

Tips for best trimming results
(Fig. 10b)

	- The correct angle for the cutting attachment is parallel to the ground.

■Do not force the trimmer. Allow the very tip of the line to do the cutting (especially along walls). Cutting with more than the tip will reduce cutting efficiency and may overload the motor.

![Figure](img_23-0323_ego_stx4500_stx4500-fc_stringtrimmer_manual_en_p33_62.png)

10b Dangerous
Cutting Area

Direction of
Rotation **Best cutting area

■ The cutting height is determined by the distance of the cutting line from the lawn surface.

■ Grass over 8 inches (20 cm) should be cut by working from top to the bottom in small increments to avoid premature line wear or motor drag.

■ Slowly move the trimmer into and out of the area being cut, maintaining the cutting head position at the desired cutting height. This movement can be either a forward-backward motion or a side-to-side motion. Cutting shorter lengths produces best results.

■ Avoid trimming when grass and weeds are wet.

■ Wire and picket fences can cause extra cutting line wear or breakage. Stone and brick walls, curbs, and wood may wear cutting line rapidly.

■ Avoid trees and shrubs. Tree bark, wood moldings, siding, and fence posts can easily be damaged by the cutting line.

LINE REPLACEMENT

NOTICE: Always use the recommended nylon cutting line with a diameter that does not exceed 0.105 in (2.7 mm). Using line other than that specified may cause the machine to overheat or become damaged.

A WARNING: Never use metal-reinforced line, wire, or rope, etc. These can break off and become dangerous projectiles.

Trimmer head assembly is shown for reference in Fig. 12a.

	1. Remove the battery pack.

	2. For 0.095" (2.4 mm) line, cut one piece of cutting line 26 ft. (8 m) long. Insert the line into the eyelet (Fig. 11a) and push the line until the end of the line comes out of the opposite eyelet. Pull the line from the other side until equal lengths of the line appear on both sides of the trimmer head.

	3. Press and rotate lower cover assembly in the direction indicated by the arrow to wind the cutting line onto the spool until approximately 6 in. (15.3 cm) of line is showing on each side (Fig. 11b).

4. Push the lower cover assembly down while pulling on the lines to manually advance the line and to check for proper assembly of the trimmer head.

RELOADING THE CUTTING LINE

USING THE MACHINE WITH 3-TOOTH BLADE (kit ABB1203-1, SOLD SEPARATELY)

To cut wild growth and scrub, lower the rotating blade down onto the growth to achieve a chopping effect. Use the brush cutter like a scythe (sweep it to the right and left) at ground level. Do not use the cutting attachment above waist height.

- A WARNING: The higher the cutting attachment is off the ground, the greater the risk of injury from cuttings being thrown sideways.

- A WARNING: When cutting young stands or other woody materials up to 3/4 in (2 cm) in diameter, use the left side of the blade to avoid blade thrust situations. Do not attempt to cut woody material with a larger diameter, since the blade may catch or jerk the brush cutter forward. This may cause damage to the blade or the brush cutter or loss of control of the brush cutter, resulting in personal injury.

- A WARNING: Improper use of a brush cutter blade may cause it to crack, chip, or shatter. Thrown parts may seriously injure the operator or bystander. To reduce the risk of personal injury, it is essential to take the following precautions:

	■ Avoid contact with hard or solid foreign objects such as stones, rocks, or pieces of metal.

	■Never cut wood or shrubs with a stem diameter of more than 3/4 in (2 cm).

	■Inspect the blade at a regular short intervals for signs of damage. Do not continue working with a damaged blade.

	■Re-sharpen the blade regularly (when it has dulled noticeably) and have it balanced if necessary (should be performed by a qualified service technician).

Blade Thrust

Exercise extreme caution when using the blade with this unit. Blade thrust is the reaction that may occur when the spinning blade contacts anything it cannot cut. This contact may cause the blade to stop for an instant and suddenly "thrust" the unit away from the object that was hit. This reaction can be violent enough to cause the operator to lose control of the unit. Blade thrust can occur without warning if the blade snags, stalls, or binds. This is more likely to occur in areas where it is difficult to see the material being cut. For cutting ease and safety, approach the weeds being cut with the brush cutter from the right to the left. In the event an unexpected object or woody stock is encountered, this practice could minimize the blade thrust reaction.

Tips for best brush-cutting

■ Always hold brush cutter on your right side with both hands when operating. Use a firm grip on both handles.

■ Maintain your grip and balance on both feet. Position yourself so that you will not be drawn off balance by the kickback reaction of the cutting blade.

■ Inspect and clear the area of any hidden objects such as glass, rocks, concrete, fencing, wire, wood, metal, etc., which can be thrown or entangled in the blade.

■ Never use blades near sidewalks, fencing, posts, buildings, or other immovable objects.

	- Never use a blade after hitting a hard object without first inspecting it for damage. Do not use if any damage is detected.

■Use the unit for cutting from the right to the left in a broad sweeping action from side to side.

■ Use only the EGO™ blade. Using any other brand blade with this brush cutter could result in serious personal injury.
