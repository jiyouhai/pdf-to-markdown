## HOW THE TEST WORKS?

The iHealth Wireless Smart Gluco-Monitoring System (BG5)
monitors glucose levels by measuring the amount of electrical currents that are generated when the glucose in your system reacts with the reagent of a test strip. The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample. The glucose meter measures the current and converts to the corresponding blood glucose level.

## IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS

- Do not use in a manner not specified by the manufacturer.


## IMPORTANT TESTING INFORMATION

- Severe dehydration and excessive water loss may cause results that are lower than actual values. If you believe you are suffering from severe dehydration, consult a healthcare professional immediately.
- If your blood glucose results are lower or higher than usual, and you do not have symptoms of illness, first repeat the test. If you have symptoms or continue to get results that are higher or lower than usual, follow the treatment advice of your healthcare professional.
- Use only fresh whole blood samples to test your blood glucose. Using other substances will result in inaccurate results.
- If you are experiencing symptoms that are inconsistent with your blood glucose test results, and you have followed all the instructions provided in this Owner's Manual, contact your healthcare professional.
- Inaccurate results may occur in severely hypotensive individuals or patients who are in shock. Test results that are lower than actual values may occur in individuals who are in a hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar state, with or without ketosis. Please consult your healthcare professional before use.


## INFORMATION ABOUT ALTERNATIVE SITE TESTING (AST)

There are limitations for doing AST. Please consult your healthcare professional before you conduct AST. The Wireless Smart Gluco-Monitoring System limits usage to steady-state blood glucose conditions only.

## What is Alternate Site Testing?

Alternate Site Testing (AST) is blood glucose self-monitoring using a blood sample collected from somewhere other than the fingertips. The Wireless Smart Gluco-Monitoring System (BG5) allows you to test on the palm, forearm, upper arm, calf, or thigh with equivalent results to fingertip testing.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_04_f3757a2bda8dfc4ee5a5g-05.jpg?height=453&width=424&top_left_y=481&top_left_x=224)

## What is the Advantage of Alternative Site Testing?

Pain is felt more readily on the fingertips because they are full of nerve endings (receptors). At other body sites where nerve endings are not so condensed, pain is not felt as acutely.

## When to Use Alternative Site Testing?

Food, medication, illness, stress and exercise can affect blood glucose levels. Capillary blood from the fingertips reflects these changes faster than capillary blood from other sites. Therefore, when testing blood glucose levels during or immediately after one of these, such as meals or exercise, take a blood sample from your fingertips only. AST should be done only during steady-state times when glucose levels are not changing rapidly.
AST is suitable in the following instances:

- In a pre-meal or fasting state (two hours or more after the last meal)
- Two hours or more after taking insulin
- Two hours or more after exercising

Caution: AST should not be used to calibrate continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMs). Results from AST should not be used in insulin dose calculations. Do not use AST if:

- You think your blood glucose is low
- You believe you may be hypoglycemic
- You are testing for hyperglycemia
- Your routine glucose results fluctuate often
- You are pregnant
