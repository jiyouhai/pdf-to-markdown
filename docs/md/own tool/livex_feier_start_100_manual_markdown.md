# Use Instruction

## About folding

1. When preparing to fold the unit, the power must be turned off;
2. Raise the treadmill to an upright position;
3. When lowering the treadmill, first hold the treadmill with your hands, step on the iron hook with your feet, and then slowly lower it to lower the treadmill to the ground.
![view image](https://dv.copilot.livex.ai/api/v1/public/file/image_b153bedc_24_1.png)

## About moving

Must make sure when moving the unit:
- **A**: The machine's power switch is turned off;
- **B**: The power plug has been unplugged from the power connector;
- **C**: The treadmill has been folded: After clarifying the above points, hold the end of the treadmill with one hand and the handrail on the same side with the other hand, and move the machine slowly when it is tilted 30°~40° to the chest.

## About operation

1. Turn on the power, unfold the treadmill to the lowest position, and check whether the treadmill is normal.
2. Clip the safety key cord with your clothes.
3. Grasp the handrail with one hand and press the "START" button with the other hand, the treadmill will start after a delay of 5 seconds and run at a speed of 1.0Km/h. Press the "speed +" button, the motor speed will increase to reach a speed of 2.5~3.5Km/h (this is the most comfortable running speed), grab the handrail with both hands at the same time, and step on the running belt with both feet one by one. Then you can run at the same speed as the running belt.
4. After a few minutes, you can run at a higher speed. If you want to increase the speed, hold the handrail with one hand and press the "speed +" button to increase the speed slowly. You can also press the "speed -" key to decrease the speed.
5. When running, press the speed quick key to quickly enter the running speed you need.
6. During the movement, you can press the “stop” key at any time to stop the motor from running.

Page 25
7. **Preset Mode Use.** Turn on the power supply, turn on the power switch, after the display is normal, press the "Program" button to select one of the automatic running modes as the current mode to run, press the "Start" button to start the treadmill, and the treadmill starts to run automatically according to the selected mode. During running, you can press "speed +" key or "speed -" key to change the running speed of the current time period. Press the "Stop" key to abort the movement.

8. **Adjustable in two gears** if the slope of the treadmill needs to be changed, after the motor stops, incline the treadmill to a certain height and adjust the rear feet pad.

9. **Heart rate test:** After the treadmill is powered on, hold both hands on the metal heartbeat sensor, and the user's heart rate value will be displayed in the heart rate display window after a few seconds.  
   (Note: This value is not used as medical data and can only be used as a sports reference.)

> **Note: When safety key pull out, the treadmill will stop immediately. And the computer can not work, the window shows “E07”.**

# Grounding guide

This product must have grounding. If error and damage occurred to the treadmill, grounding wire can form one circuit with lowest resistance; the current can be guided into the ground to reduce the danger of electric shock. This product is equipped with one cable, which has one grounding conductor and grounding plug. The treadmill must be grounded with correct socket that is compatible with local rules.

**Alert!**  
If you do not know whether the equipment is properly grounded, please consult a qualified electrician or maintenance personnel. Please do not change the plug attached to this product without authorization. If the plug is inconsistent with the socket, let a qualified electrician install a suitable socket. It should be under 110-120V and matches with this kind of socket as shown.

# Treadmill maintenance

Proper maintenance is very important to ensure a faultless and operational condition of the treadmill. Improper maintenance can cause damage to the treadmill or shorten the life of the product. All parts of the treadmill must be checked and tightened regularly. Worn out parts must be replaced immediately.

## BELT ADJUSTMENT

You may need to adjust the running belt during the first few weeks of use. All running belts are properly set at the factory. It may stretch or be off center after use. Stretching is normal during the break-in period.

### ADJUSTING THE BELT TENSION:

If the running belt feels as though it is slipping or hesitating when you plant your foot during a run, the tension on the running belt may have to be increased.

#### TO INCREASE THE RUNNING BELT TENSION:

1. Place 8mm wrench on the left belt tension bolt. Turn the wrench clockwise 1/4 turn to draw the rear roller and increase the belt tension.
2. Repeat STEP 1 for the right belt tension bolt. You must be sure to turn both bolts the same number of turns, so the rear roller will stay square relative to the frame.
3. Repeat STEP 1 and STEP 2 until the slipping is eliminated.
4. Be careful not to tighten the running belt tension too much as you can create

An excessively tightened running belt may damage the roller bearings that would result in bearing noise from the front and rear rollers.

**TO DECREASE THE TENSION ON THE RUNNING BELT, TURN BOTH BOLTS COUNTER-CLOCKWISE THE SAME NUMBER OF TURNS.**

## CENTRING THE RUNNING BELT

When you run, you may push off harder with one foot than with another. The severity of the deflection depends on the amount of force that one foot exerts in relation to the other. This deflection can cause the belt to move off-center. This deflection is normal and the running belt will center when nobody is on the running belt. If the running belt remains consistently off-center, you will need to center the running belt manually.

Start the treadmill without anyone on the running belt, increase speed to 6km/h.

1. Observe whether the running belt is toward the right or left side of the deck.
   - If toward the left side of the deck, using wrench, turn the left adjustment bolt clockwise 1/4 turn and the left adjustment bolt counter clockwise 1/4.
   - If toward the right side of the deck, turn the right adjustment bolt clockwise 1/4 turn and the left adjustment bolt counter clockwise 1/4.
   - If the belt is still not center, repeat the above step until the running belt is on center.
2. After the belt is center, increase the speed to 13kph and verify that it is running smoothly. Repeat the

# Lubrication

The treadmill is factory-lubricated. However, it is recommended to check the lubrication of the treadmill regularly, to ensure an optimal operation of the treadmill. It is usually not necessary to lubricate the treadmill in the first year or the first 500 hours of operation.

After every 3 months of operation, lift the sides of the treadmill and feel the surface of the belt, as far as possible. If traces of silicon spray are found, lubrication is not necessary.
![view image](https://dv.copilot.livex.ai/api/v1/public/file/image_7c6e519d_27_2.png)

In case of a dry surface refer to the following instructions.

Only use oil free silicon spray.

**Application of lubricant on the belt:**

- Position the belt so that the seam is located in the middle of the plate.
- Insert the spray valve in the spray head of the lubricant container.
- Lift the belt at one side and hold the spray valve in a distance to the front end of striding belt and plate. Start at the front end of the belt. Lead the spray valve in direction of the back end. Repeat this process on the other side of the belt. Spray each side for about 4 seconds.
- Wait 1 minute to let the silicon spray spread, before starting the machine.
![view image](https://dv.copilot.livex.ai/api/v1/public/file/image_7c6e519d_27_1.png)

## CLEANING:

Regular cleaning of the striding belt ensures a long product life.

- **Warning:** The treadmill must be turned off to avoid electrical shocks. The power cord must be pulled out of the socket, before starting the cleaning or maintenance.
- **After each training:** Wipe the console and other surfaces with a clean soft and damp cloth to remove sweat residues.

*Caution:* Do not use any abrasives or solvents. To avoid damage to the computer, keep any liquids away. Do not expose the computer to direct sunlight.

- **Weekly:** To make the cleaning easier it is recommended to use a mat for the treadmill. Shoes can leave dirt on the striding belt that can fall beneath the treadmill. Clean the mat under the treadmill once a week.

## STORAGE:

Store your treadmill in a clean and dry environment. Ensure the master power switch is off and is unplugged from the electrical wall outlet.
