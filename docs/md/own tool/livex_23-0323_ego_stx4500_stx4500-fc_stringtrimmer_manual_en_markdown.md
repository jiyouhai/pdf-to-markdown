# EGO

- **While operating the machine, always wear safety footwear. Do not operate the machine when barefoot or wearing open sandals.** This reduces the chance of injury to the feet from contact with a moving cutter, line or blade.

- **While operating the machine, always wear long trousers.** Exposed skin increases the likelihood of injury from thrown objects.

- **Keep bystanders away while operating the machine.** Thrown debris can result in serious personal injury.

- **Always use two hands when operating the machine.** Holding the machine with both hands will avoid loss of control.

- **Hold the machine by the insulated gripping surfaces only, because the cutting line or blade may contact hidden wiring.** Cutting line or blades contacting a "live" wire may make exposed metal parts of the machine "live" and could give the operator an electric shock.

- **Always keep proper footing and operate the machine only when standing on the ground.** Slippery or unstable surfaces may cause a loss of balance or control of the machine.

- **Do not operate the machine on excessively steep slopes.** This reduces the risk of loss of control, slipping, and falling which may result in personal injury.

- **When working on slopes, always be sure of your footing, always work across the face of slopes, never up or down and exercise extreme caution when changing direction.** This reduces the risk of loss of control, slipping, and falling which may result in personal injury.

- **Keep all parts of the body away from the cutter, line or blade when the machine is operating. Before you start the machine, make sure the cutter, line or blade is not contacting anything.** A moment of inattention while operating the machine may result in injury to yourself or others.

- **Do not operate the machine above waist height.** This helps prevent unintended cutter or blade contact and enables better control of the machine in unexpected situations.

- **When cutting brush or saplings that are under tension, be alert for spring back.** When the tension in the wood fibers is released, the brush or sapling may strike the operator and/or throw the machine out of control.

- **Use extreme caution when cutting brush and saplings.** The slender material may catch the blade and be whipped toward you or pull you off balance.

- **Maintain control of the machine and do not touch cutters, lines or blades and other hazardous moving parts while they are still in motion.** This reduces the risk of injury from moving parts.

12  
**56-VOLT LITHIUM-ION COMMERCIAL 17.5” STRING TRIMMER — STX4500/STX4500-FC**
- **Carry the machine with the machine switched off and away from your body.** Proper handling of the machine will reduce the likelihood of accidental contact with a moving cutter, line or blade.

- **Only use replacement cutters, lines, cutting heads and blades specified by the manufacturer.** Incorrect replacement parts may increase the risk of breakage and injury.

- **When clearing jammed material or servicing the machine, make sure the switch is off and the battery pack is removed.** Unexpected starting of the machine while clearing jammed material or servicing may result in serious personal injury.

- **When transporting or storing the machine, always fit the cover on metal blades.** 

- Proper handling of the machine will reduce the likelihood of accidental contact with the blade.

- **Damage to Trimmer** - If you strike a foreign object with the trimmer or it becomes entangled, stop the machine immediately, check for damage and have any damage repaired before further operation is attempted. Do not operate with a broken guard or spool.

- **If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the motor and check immediately for the cause.** Vibration is generally a warning of trouble. A loose head may vibrate, crack, break or come off the trimmer, which may result in serious or fatal injury. Make sure that the cutting attachment is properly fixed in position. If the head loosens after fixing it in position, replace it immediately. Never use a trimmer with a loose cutting attachment.

- **Use only with the battery packs and chargers listed below:**

# Blade thrust causes and related warnings

Blade thrust is a sudden sideways, forward or backward motion of the machine, which may occur when the blade jams or catches on an object such as a sapling or a tree stump. It can be violent enough to cause the machine and/or operator to be propelled in any direction, and possibly lose control of the machine.

Blade thrust and its related hazards can be avoided by taking proper precautions as given below.

- **Maintain a firm grip with both hands on the machine and position your arms to resist blade thrust. Position your body to the left side of the machine.** Blade thrust can increase the risk of injury due to the machine moving unexpectedly. Blade thrust can be controlled by the operator if proper precautions are taken.

- **If the blade binds, or when interrupting a cut for any reason, switch the machine off and hold the machine motionless in the material until the blade comes to a complete stop. While the blade is binding, never attempt to remove the machine from the material or pull the machine backward while the blade is in motion, otherwise blade thrust may occur.** Investigate and take corrective actions to eliminate the cause of blade binding.

- **Do not use blunt or damaged blades.** Blunt or damaged blades increase the risk of jamming or catching on an object, resulting in blade thrust.

- **Always maintain good visibility of the material being cut.** Blade thrust is more likely to occur in areas where it is difficult to see the material being cut.

- **If you are approached by another person while operating the machine, switch the machine off.** There is an increased risk of injury to other persons being struck by the moving blade in the event of blade thrust.

**SAVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS!**

# ADJUSTING THE CUTTING LINE LENGTH

The trimmer head allows the operator to release more cutting line without stopping the motor. As line becomes frayed or worn, additional line can be released by lightly tapping the trimmer head on the ground while operating the trimmer (Fig. 10a).

![Image of trimmer head in operation with line being released.](#)

### WARNING: 

Do not remove or alter the line-cutting blade assembly. Excessive line length will cause the motor to overheat and may result in serious personal injury.

For best results, tap the trimmer head on bare ground or hard soil. If line release is attempted in tall grass, the motor may overheat. Always keep the trimming line fully extended. Line release becomes more difficult as the cutting line becomes shorter. Replace the line when necessary. For instructions, please see section "LINE REPLACEMENT".

**Page 32**

56-VOLT LITHIUM-ION COMMERCIAL 17.5” STRING TRIMMER — STX4500/STX4500-FC
# Tips for Best Trimming Results (Fig. 10b)

- The correct angle for the cutting attachment is parallel to the ground.
- Do not force the trimmer. Allow the very tip of the line to do the cutting (especially along walls). Cutting with more than the tip will reduce cutting efficiency and may overload the motor.
- The cutting height is determined by the distance of the cutting line from the lawn surface.
- Grass over 8 inches (20 cm) should be cut by working from top to the bottom in small increments to avoid premature line wear or motor drag.
- Slowly move the trimmer into and out of the area being cut, maintaining the cutting head position at the desired cutting height. This movement can be either a forward-backward motion or a side-to-side motion. Cutting shorter lengths produces best results.
- Avoid trimming when grass and weeds are wet.
- Wire and picket fences can cause extra cutting line wear or breakage. Stone and brick walls, curbs, and wood may wear cutting line rapidly.
- Avoid trees and shrubs. Tree bark, wood moldings, siding, and fence posts can easily be damaged by the cutting line.

# USING THE MACHINE WITH 3-TOOTH BLADE (kit ABB1203-1, SOLD SEPARATELY)

To cut wild growth and scrub, lower the rotating blade down onto the growth to achieve a chopping effect. Use the brush cutter like a scythe (sweep it to the right and left) at ground level. Do not use the cutting attachment above waist height.

### ![warning-icon](icon)
**WARNING:** The higher the cutting attachment is off the ground, the greater the risk of injury from cuttings being thrown sideways.

### ![warning-icon](icon)
**WARNING:** When cutting young stands or other woody materials up to 3/4 in (2 cm) in diameter, use the left side of the blade to avoid blade thrust situations. Do not attempt to cut woody material with a larger diameter, since the blade may catch or jerk the brush cutter forward. This may cause damage to the blade or the brush cutter or loss of control of the brush cutter, resulting in personal injury.

### ![warning-icon](icon)
**WARNING:** Improper use of a brush cutter blade may cause it to crack, chip, or shatter. Thrown parts may seriously injure the operator or bystander. To reduce the risk of personal injury, it is essential to take the following precautions:

- Avoid contact with hard or solid foreign objects such as stones, rocks, or pieces of metal.
- Never cut wood or shrubs with a stem diameter of more than 3/4 in (2 cm).
- Inspect the blade at regular short intervals for signs of damage. Do not continue working with a damaged blade.
- Re-sharpen the blade regularly (when it has dulled noticeably) and have it balanced if necessary (should be performed by a qualified service technician).

## Blade Thrust

Exercise extreme caution when using the blade with this unit. Blade thrust is the reaction that may occur when the spinning blade contacts anything it cannot cut. This contact may cause the blade to stop for an instant and suddenly “thrust” the unit away from the object that was hit. This reaction can be violent enough to cause the operator to lose control of the unit. Blade thrust can occur without warning if the blade snags, stalls, or binds. This is more likely to occur in areas where it is difficult to see the material being cut. For cutting ease and safety, approach the weeds being cut with the brush cutter from the right to the left. In the event an unexpected object or woody stock is encountered, this practice could minimize the blade thrust reaction.

56-VOLT LITHIUM-ION COMMERCIAL 17.5” STRING TRIMMER — STX4500/STX4500-FC 39
# Tips for Best Brush-Cutting

- Always hold the brush cutter on your right side with both hands when operating. Use a firm grip on both handles.
- Maintain your grip and balance on both feet. Position yourself so that you will not be drawn off balance by the kickback reaction of the cutting blade.
- Inspect and clear the area of any hidden objects such as glass, rocks, concrete, fencing, wire, wood, metal, etc., which can be thrown or entangled in the blade.
- Never use blades near sidewalks, fencing, posts, buildings, or other immovable objects.
- Never use a blade after hitting a hard object without first inspecting it for damage. Do not use if any damage is detected.
- Use the unit for cutting from the right to the left in a broad sweeping action from side to side.
- Use only the EGO™ blade. Using any other brand blade with this brush cutter could result in serious personal injury.
