- Do not use the Wireless Smart Glucose Meter where aerosol sprays are being used or where oxygen is being administered.
- Do not use in a manner not specified by the manufacturer.

# Important Testing Information

- Severe dehydration and excessive water loss may cause results that are lower than actual values. If you believe you are suffering from severe dehydration, consult a healthcare professional immediately.
- If your blood glucose results are lower or higher than usual, and you do not have symptoms of illness, first repeat the test. If you have symptoms or continue to get results that are higher or lower than usual, follow the treatment advice of your healthcare professional.
- Use only fresh whole blood samples to test your blood glucose. Using other substances will result in inaccurate results.
- If you are experiencing symptoms that are inconsistent with your blood glucose test results, and you have followed all the instructions provided in this Owner’s Manual, contact your healthcare professional.
- Inaccurate results may occur in severely hypotensive individuals or patients who are in shock. Test results that are lower than actual values may occur in individuals who are in a hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar state, with or without ketosis. Please consult your healthcare professional before use.

Monitors glucose levels by measuring the amount of electrical currents that are generated when the glucose in your system reacts with the reagent of a test strip. The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample. The glucose meter measures the current and converts to the corresponding blood glucose level.
# INFORMATION ABOUT ALTERNATIVE SITE TESTING (AST)

There are limitations for doing AST. Please consult your healthcare professional before you conduct AST. The Wireless Smart Gluco-Monitoring System limits usage to steady-state blood glucose conditions only.

## What is Alternate Site Testing?

Alternate Site Testing (AST) is blood glucose self-monitoring using a blood sample collected from somewhere other than the fingertips. The Wireless Smart Gluco-Monitoring System (BG5) allows you to test on the palm, forearm, upper arm, calf, or thigh with equivalent results to fingertip testing.

![Body Diagram Showing Testing Sites](diagram)

## What is the Advantage of Alternative Site Testing?

Pain is felt more readily on the fingertips because they are full of nerve endings (receptors). At other body sites where nerve endings are not so condensed, pain is not felt as acutely.

## When to Use Alternative Site Testing?

Food, medication, illness, stress and exercise can affect blood glucose levels. Capillary blood from the fingertips reflects these changes faster than capillary blood from other sites. Therefore, when testing blood glucose levels during or immediately after one of these, such as meals or exercise, take a blood sample from your fingertips only. AST should be done only during steady-state times when glucose levels are not changing rapidly.

AST is suitable in the following instances:

- In a pre-meal or fasting state (two hours or more after the last meal)
- Two hours or more after taking insulin
- Two hours or more after exercising

**Caution:** AST should not be used to calibrate continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMs). Results from AST should not be used in insulin dose calculations. Do not use AST if:
- You think your blood glucose is low
- You believe you may be hypoglycemic
- You are testing for hyperglycemia
- Your routine glucose results fluctuate often
- You are pregnant

## COMPARING GLUCOSE METER TEST RESULTS WITH LABORATORY RESULTS

The Wireless Smart Glucose Meter provides you with whole blood equivalent results. The result you obtain from your glucose meter may differ somewhat from your laboratory results due to normal variation. The Wireless Smart Glucose Meter results can be affected by factors and conditions that do not affect laboratory results in the same way. To make an accurate comparison between the Wireless Smart Glucose Meter and laboratory results, follow the guidelines below.

### Before Going to the Lab
- Perform a Control Solution test to make sure that the meter is working properly.
- If possible, fast for at least eight hours before conducting a comparison test.
- Take your Wireless Smart Glucose Meter with you to the lab.

### While at the Lab
- Make sure that samples for both tests are taken and tested within 15 minutes of each other.
- Wash your hands before obtaining a blood sample.
- Never use your glucose meter with blood samples collected in a test tube.
- Use fresh capillary blood only.

## CLEANING AND DISINFECTION

The cleaning and disinfection is absolutely necessary for the test procedure, because cleaning can ensure the meter works well (for example, display will be clear to see after cleaning); and disinfection can avoid the infection to you or to other people, and the cross-infection. We strongly warn that the protective cover is needed when using the iOS device to test the blood glucose, the meter and lancing device should be cleaned and disinfected following use. And we suggest you use the following product: CaviWipes (EPA registration number: 46781-8). 

The CaviWipes, with Isopropanol and Diisobutyl-phenoxy-
ethoxyethyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride as the active ingredient, have been shown to be safe for use with the BG5 Blood Glucose meter and lancing device. You can purchase this product according to the following information: visit the website [www.metrex.com](http://www.metrex.com) or contact Metrex at 800-841-1428 for product or technical information.

The meter and the lancing device are for single-patient use. If the user tests 5-6 times every day, the devices may be cleaned and disinfected 5-6 times per day. As a result, there will be 11,000 cycles of cleanings plus disinfections (1 cycle = 1 cleaning + 1 disinfection) for the meter and the device during its 5-year life cycle.

1. After the test, the user should clean and wash hands, and then put on the disposable glove.
2. Use the Cavi WipesTM (Metrex® RESERCH CORPORATION, EPA Reg. NO. 46781-8, EPA Est. No. 56952-WI-001) to clean and disinfect the meter’s housing and lens.
