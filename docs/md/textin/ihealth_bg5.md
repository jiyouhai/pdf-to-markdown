<!-- 45 -->

# INFORMATION ABOUT ALTERNATIVE SITE TESTING (AST)

There are limitations for doing AST. Please consult your healthcare professional before you conduct AST. The Wireless Smart Gluco-Monitoring System limits usage to steady-state blood glucose conditions only.

## What is Alternate Site Testing?

Alternate Site Testing (AST) is blood glucose self-monitoring using a blood sample collected from somewhere other than the ﬁngertips. The Wireless Smart Gluco-Monitoring System (BG5) allows you to test on the palm, forearm, upper arm, calf, or thigh with equivalent results to ﬁngertip testing. 

<!-- Upper Arm Forearm Thigh PalmCalf Finger -->

## What is the Advantage of Alternative Site Testing?

Pain is felt more readily on the ﬁngertips because they are full of nerve endings (receptors). At other body sites where nerve endings are not so condensed, pain is not felt as acutely.

## When to Use Alternative Site Testing?

Food, medication, illness, stress and exercise can affect blood glucose levels. Capillary blood from the ﬁngertips reﬂects these changes faster than capillary blood from other sites. Therefore, when testing blood glucose levels during or immediately after one of these , such as meals or exercise, take a blood sample from your ﬁngertips only. AST should be done only during steady–state times when glucose levels are not changing rapidly.

AST is suitable in the following instances:

• In a pre-meal or fasting state (two hours or more after the last meal)

• Two hours or more after taking insulin

• Two hours or more after exercising

Caution: AST should not be used to calibrate continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMs). Results from AST should not be used in insulin dose calculations. Do not use AST if:

• You think your blood glucose is low

• You believe you may be hypoglycemic

• You are testing for hyperglycemia

• Your routine glucose results ﬂuctuate often

• You are pregnant
